## ðŸ“‘Project description:
A simple web-application that supports authentication and registration.
It is based on 3 models: `Manufacturer`, `Car` and `Driver`, on which you can perform basic `CRUD` operations.
They are interconnected by the following relationships:
+ `Car` -> `Manufacturer` : Every `Car` is associated with a `Manufacturer`;
+ `Driver` <--> `Car`: Every `Driver` is associated with a `Car` and vice versa.
